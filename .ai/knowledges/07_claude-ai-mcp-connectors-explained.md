## Overview

Claude.ai exposes a set of **pre-registered MCP servers** — Notion, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Parallel Web Search, and others — that show up automatically in Claude Code without any local `claude mcp add` or `.mcp.json` entry. These are called **connectors**. Their tool names use the prefix `mcp__claude_ai_<service>__<tool>` (with spaces in the service name converted to underscores).

A connector is not a separate kind of MCP server — it's still a Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint at the same URL the service would publish to anyone (e.g., Notion's connector is at `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`, identical to a manual install). What's different is **who manages the OAuth flow and token**: claude.ai does, on behalf of your Anthropic account, instead of you wiring it up locally.

This document explains how that works on the client side, where state lives, and the practical implications.

## Evidence from a working machine

| Artifact | Location | What it tells us |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feature flag | `~/.claude.json` → `"tengu_claudeai_mcp_connectors": true` | The connector layer is gated behind a Claude Code feature flag. Without it, claude.ai's connectors do not surface as MCP servers. |
| Connection history | `~/.claude.json` → `"claudeAiMcpEverConnected": [...]` | Local list of connector names that have ever been authenticated. Used to decide which to mount on session start. |
| Auth-needed cache | `~/.claude/mcp-needs-auth-cache.json` | Map of connector name → timestamp for connectors whose OAuth has expired or never completed. Shown as `! Needs authentication` in `claude mcp list`. |
| Connector name format | `claude mcp list` output | Connectors appear as `claude.ai <Service Name>` (note the space). Local MCP servers appear unprefixed. Plugins appear as `plugin:<plugin-name>:<server>`. |
| No CLI surface | `claude mcp --help` | The `claude mcp` subcommand has only `add`, `get`, `list`, `remove`, `add-from-claude-desktop`, `add-json`, `reset-project-choices`, `serve`. **No connector subcommand.** Connectors are not managed through this CLI. |

What this means in practice: a connector is a small piece of cloud-managed configuration (the OAuth token and possibly the URL) that Claude Code fetches and mounts at startup, distinct from anything you can write into `~/.claude.json` directly via the CLI.

## Three kinds of MCP servers in Claude Code

Useful to keep straight, because they have different management surfaces:

| Kind | Naming | Where it's configured | Where auth lives | Cross-project? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Connector** | `claude.ai <Name>` | claude.ai web UI (Settings → Connectors). Tied to your Anthropic account. | Anthropic / claude.ai side. Local cache in `~/.claude/mcp-needs-auth-cache.json`. | Yes — same Anthropic account, every Claude Code session. |
| **Local MCP server** | bare name (e.g., `context7`) | `claude mcp add` (writes to `~/.claude.json` user or project scope) or `.mcp.json` at repo root | Local OAuth tokens stored by Claude Code (managed by the client itself). | User-scope: yes. Project-scope: per-repo. |
| **Plugin MCP server** | `plugin:<plugin>:<server>` | Bundled inside a Claude Code plugin under `~/.claude/plugins/` | Whatever the plugin specifies | Per plugin install scope |

The `claude.ai Notion` connector and a manually-added `notion` server at the same URL are **functionally the same upstream MCP server** — same tools, same data, same rate limits. The difference is purely in who orchestrates OAuth.

---

## Lifecycle of a connector

### 1. Discovery

When Claude Code starts a session with `tengu_claudeai_mcp_connectors: true`, it asks claude.ai which connectors the user has connected. The answer is in `claudeAiMcpEverConnected` (read-through cache; the authoritative source is claude.ai).

### 2. Mount

For each connector in that list whose auth is still valid (not in `mcp-needs-auth-cache.json`), Claude Code mounts it as an MCP server. Its tools become available as `mcp__claude_ai_<service>__*`. They appear in tool search and in `/mcp`.

### 3. Use

Tool calls flow through the connector exactly like any HTTP MCP server. The MCP endpoint sees a request authenticated as the OAuth-bound Notion user. Rate limits and capabilities are whatever the upstream service publishes (for Notion: ~180 req/min, search at 30/min, see `analyses/35_notion_mcp_manual.md` §2).

### 4. Re-auth / expiry

When a token expires or is revoked, the connector lands in `mcp-needs-auth-cache.json` and shows `! Needs authentication` in `claude mcp list`. The user re-authorizes at claude.ai → Settings → Connectors. Claude Code picks up the new state at the next session start (or possibly sooner via a refresh).

### 5. Disconnect

Done from claude.ai → Settings → Connectors → Disconnect. Removes the token at the Anthropic side and (on next session start) removes the entry from `claudeAiMcpEverConnected`.

## Where the OAuth identity binds — and why this is the same pitfall as a local install

The Notion connector's OAuth flow opens a browser window. Whichever Notion account is **currently signed into that browser** becomes the bound account. This is true regardless of whether you initiate the flow from claude.ai's Settings page or from a local `claude mcp add` — Notion's OAuth server only knows which session cookie the browser sent.

Practical consequence observed in this repo: when the Notion connector was first authorized, the active browser session was logged into a Notion account other than the one the user intended (`mslee@lucidate.news` instead of `remy@curationlabs.ai`). The connector ended up bound to the wrong identity. All subsequent reads and writes — including `notion-search` and `notion-create-pages` calls — used that account, which is why created pages landed in the wrong user's Private space.

**Always verify identity immediately after authorizing a connector** by calling `notion-get-self` and inspecting the returned name/email. This is non-negotiable for any agent that will perform writes. The same pre-step also applies to switching connectors: log into the browser as the intended account *first*, *then* trigger the re-auth.

## Why our harness's `~/.claude/settings.json mcpServers` entry was silently ignored

The bgng harness writes MCP server definitions into `~/.claude/settings.json` under `mcpServers`. Observed behavior in current Claude Code: `claude mcp list` and `claude mcp get <name>` do **not** see entries from that path. They see only:

- Connectors (from the claude.ai layer above)
- Servers added via `claude mcp add` (stored in `~/.claude.json`, keyed by scope and project)
- Project-scoped servers from `.mcp.json` in the repo root
- Plugin-provided servers from `~/.claude/plugins/`

The `mcpServers` field in `~/.claude/settings.json` either is no longer read for MCP runtime registration, or is read for a different purpose we have not identified. This was not always the case — the harness's design predates this state. For Claude Code today, the path that works is either Path A (the connector, this document) or Path B (`claude mcp add` to `~/.claude.json`). Codex and Cursor continue to read their respective files as the harness writes them. See `knowledges/06_notion-mcp-setup-guide.md` for the per-tool guidance.

---

## Switching connector identity (the procedure that fits this layer)

If a connector is bound to the wrong account:

1. Open https://claude.ai → **Settings → Connectors**.
2. Find the misbound connector, click **Disconnect**.
3. In the same browser, open `notion.so` (or the relevant service) and sign out of the wrong account.
4. Sign into the service as the intended account. Confirm by visiting the service's home and reading the displayed name/email.
5. Back at claude.ai → Settings → Connectors → **Connect** for that service.
6. Restart Claude Code. (Connector state is fetched at session start.)
7. From the new Claude Code session, ask the agent to call `notion-get-self` (or `mcp__claude_ai_<service>__*` equivalent). Verify it returns the intended identity before any writes.

## What you cannot do with connectors

- **Connect two Notion accounts simultaneously.** One Anthropic account → one Notion connector → one bound Notion user. If you need two identities (e.g., personal + work), use one as a connector and the other as a locally-installed MCP server (`claude mcp add` with a different server name).
- **Use bearer-token auth.** Connectors are OAuth-only by design; there is no way to inject an integration token.
- **Run headless / unattended.** OAuth requires interactive consent. For CI use, install the upstream MCP server locally with an integration token, or call the service's REST API directly.
- **Pin a specific URL.** The URL is whatever claude.ai's connector definition says it is. If the upstream service moves endpoints, claude.ai updates the connector. Your local config has no opinion on it.

---

## Comparison: connector vs the alternatives

For Notion specifically, in order of friction:

| Setup | Repo changes | Cross-project | Auth managed by | Bearer-token mode | Headless |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| claude.ai Notion **connector** | None | Yes | claude.ai | No | No |
| `claude mcp add --scope user` | None | Yes (per machine) | Claude Code (local) | No | No |
| `.mcp.json` (project scope) | Committed | No (per repo) | Claude Code (local, prompted) | No | No |
| bgng harness sync | Registry edit | Per-repo | Each client | No | No |
| Manual REST API calls | App code | App-defined | App | Yes | Yes |
| Open-source local Notion MCP server | App code + server install | Per-machine | Integration token | Yes | Yes |

If the connector covers the workflow, prefer it — it has the least configuration drift. Reach for the others only when the connector can't (multiple identities, headless, project pinning).

## What we have *not* verified

Honest delineation, since this layer is newer:

- **Where OAuth tokens actually live.** Local artifacts only show *which* connectors are connected/need-auth, never the tokens themselves. The token is presumably stored server-side at claude.ai, with Claude Code pulling tool definitions through an authenticated channel tied to the Anthropic account. This is consistent with the observation that disconnecting at claude.ai immediately changes Claude Code's behavior, but we have not confirmed it by inspecting network traffic or token storage.
- **The exact mount-time protocol.** Whether Claude Code fetches the connector list at every session start, or caches it, and how invalidations propagate.
- **Whether `tengu_claudeai_mcp_connectors` is a kill switch or a rollout flag.** The `tengu_` prefix is consistent with Anthropic-internal feature gating, but its long-term meaning is not documented externally.
- **Why `~/.claude/settings.json mcpServers` is not consumed by current Claude Code MCP runtime.** Worth filing upstream once we have a tighter repro. Until then, treat the harness's Claude target as effectively no-op and use Path A or B for Claude Code.

Update this section as we learn more.

## Troubleshooting

**Connector tools missing from a session:**
- `claude mcp list` — does the connector appear?
- If yes but tagged `! Needs authentication`: re-OAuth at claude.ai → Settings → Connectors.
- If absent entirely: check that `tengu_claudeai_mcp_connectors` is `true` in `~/.claude.json`, and that the connector is connected at claude.ai. Restart Claude Code to refresh.

**Tool calls return data from an unexpected workspace:**
- The OAuth bound to a different identity than intended. Run `notion-get-self` to confirm. If wrong, run the switching procedure above.

**`claude mcp get notion` says "No MCP server found":**
- That's expected for connectors. They are named `claude.ai Notion` (with space), not `notion`. Use `claude mcp list` to see the actual names. `claude mcp get` only finds locally-installed servers from `~/.claude.json` and `.mcp.json`, not connectors.

**Two Notion entries in `claude mcp list`:**
- You probably have both the claude.ai Notion connector AND a locally-installed `notion` server pointed at the same URL. Pick one. Two registrations duplicate OAuth prompts and can produce conflicting tool sets. Mentor memo §8: do not install multiple Notion MCP servers.

## When to share this document

Hand to anyone who:
- Sees `mcp__claude_ai_*__` tools in Claude Code without remembering how they got there.
- Wants to understand why `claude mcp get <name>` finds locally-added servers but not connectors.
- Is debugging an MCP integration that returns data from the wrong workspace or account.
- Is evaluating whether to use the connector vs install the upstream MCP server locally.

Pair it with `knowledges/06_notion-mcp-setup-guide.md` if they're also doing fresh setup in a different repo.
