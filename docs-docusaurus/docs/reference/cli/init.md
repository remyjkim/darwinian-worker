# Init

`drwn init` creates the per-project config scaffold at `<project>/.agents/drwn/config.json`. In a TTY it runs guided setup; in non-interactive contexts it writes a minimal config.

Bootstrap a project from an interactive shell:

```bash
drwn init
```

When machine state is missing, guided init first offers the opt-out Recommended
Darwinian Operator profile. It then prompts for project extensions such as
Parallel and Beads. Project extension answers affect project config only.

For scripts and CI:

```bash
drwn init --non-interactive
drwn init --minimal
```

`--non-interactive` and `--minimal` are equivalent: both skip prompts and write
the minimal first-supported project contract:

```json
{
  "schema": "drwn.project-config",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "workers": [],
  "activeWorker": null
}
```

This is explicit empty project intent. Add one or more alternative roots with
`drwn add`, then select at most one with `drwn use` before projection.

Force the guided flow even when invoked with flags:

```bash
drwn init --guided
```

Re-run setup on a project that already has a config:

```bash
drwn init --force
drwn init --force --guided
```

Without `--force`, `drwn init` refuses to overwrite an existing project config.

Skip pre-registering the default community card catalog:

```bash
drwn init --no-default-catalogs
```

By default, `drwn init` registers the public Curation Labs community card catalog into `~/.agents/drwn/catalogs.json` so that `drwn search card <query>` works out of the box:

```text
https://github.com/curation-labs/dm-cards-catalog-v1.git
```

The default catalog URL is configured in the packaged registry at `defaults.communityCatalogUrl` (currently `https://github.com/curation-labs/dm-cards-catalog-v1.git`). To swap it for a fork or a private catalog, edit `registry/config.json` and rerun `drwn init`. To disable the default registration entirely without using the flag every time, set `defaults.communityCatalogUrl` to `null`.

## Side effects

- Writes `<project>/.agents/drwn/config.json`.
- Initializes missing strict `drwn.machine` V1 state. Prompt-free modes write explicit empty machine intent; guided mode may select the pinned Operator profile.
- In guided mode, may add `extensions.parallel` and/or `extensions.beads` blocks based on prompt answers.
- Registers the default `@community` card catalog under `~/.agents/drwn/` unless `--no-default-catalogs` is passed.
- Reads `<project>/.gitignore` if present and warns when it appears to exclude `.agents`. The file is never mutated.

## What you can edit afterward

The project overlay can:

- declare alternative Worker roots and one selected root
- enable or disable MCP servers for this project
- add project-local MCP server definitions
- enable extensions such as Parallel, Beads, or MarkItDown
- include or exclude skills during write
- enable or disable targets locally

See [Per-project configuration](../../guides/per-project-patterns) and `.ai/knowledges/02_per-project-config-guide.md` for the full overlay model.

The Recommended Darwinian Operator profile pins
`@darwinian/operator@1.0.2` for machine-safe capability projection. It is not
part of the project scaffold and is not a Worker. Machine capability output may
remain ambient to project sessions, but project declarations never inherit it.
