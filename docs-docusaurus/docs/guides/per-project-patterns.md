# Per-Project Override Patterns

This guide shows when to use per-project config, how to scaffold it, and the
common patterns for declaring one reproducible project harness.

## When To Use Per-Project Config

Use a project config whenever a project needs a Worker or explicit capability
intent. Examples:

- a project should select one Blueprint from several alternative roots
- a project should add its own local MCP server
- a project should enable Parallel, Beads, or MarkItDown without enabling them globally
- a project should disable a downstream target (e.g. no Cursor)

Machine capabilities remain machine-scoped and may be visible ambiently in project
sessions. They are not inherited as project declarations.

## Scaffold

```bash
cd /path/to/project
drwn init
```

This creates:

```text
<project>/.agents/drwn/config.json
```

Use `--non-interactive` or `--minimal` for scripts. `--force` overwrites an
existing config.

## What Project Config Can Do

A project config can:

- declare alternative Card or Blueprint roots and select at most one
- toggle existing MCP servers on or off for one project
- add project-local MCP server definitions
- enable extensions (Parallel, Beads, MarkItDown) for one project
- include or exclude skills during write
- enable or disable downstream targets for one project

## Discovery

Discovery walks **upward** from the current working directory and stops at the
first matching config. Commands outside a configured project fall back to the
machine-wide harness view. Discovery affects `drwn write`, `drwn mcp list`,
`drwn mcp write`, `drwn status`, `drwn doctor`, and all `drwn extensions`
subcommands.

## Full Extension Example

```json
{
  "schema": "drwn.project-config",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "workers": ["@team/operator@^1.0.0"],
  "activeWorker": "@team/operator",
  "extensions": {
    "parallel": {
      "enabled": true,
      "skills": true,
      "mcp": false
    },
    "beads": {
      "enabled": true,
      "targets": ["codex", "claude"],
      "includeSkill": true
    },
    "markitdown": {
      "enabled": true,
      "skills": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Include vs Exclude Precedence

`skills.include` adds repo-native and package-backed skills into the project
write. `skills.exclude` removes matching skills from project write.

If an extension derives a skill and `skills.exclude` names the same skill,
**`skills.exclude` wins**. Unknown skill names in `skills.include` fail
`drwn write` before mutation and are also reported by `drwn doctor`.

## Declared And Ambient Scope

Project capabilities are resolved only from project-owned inputs:

```text
selected Worker root closure -> explicit project overlays -> explicit local overlay
```

Machine capability selections and user-home target files are not copied into project intent,
lock state, or generated Worker aggregates. Status and doctor may report them as
diagnostic-only ambient observations because downstream clients can still expose
user-home state during a project session.

## Recommended Workflow

```bash
cd /path/to/project
drwn init
drwn add @team/operator@^1.0.0
drwn use @team/operator --no-write
drwn add mcp context7
drwn status
drwn write --dry-run
drwn doctor
drwn write
```
