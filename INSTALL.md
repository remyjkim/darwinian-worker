# Install `drwn` And Set Up A Project Worker

`darwinian` is the package. `drwn` is the command. The CLI manages reusable Cards, Worker Blueprints, project state, machine inventory, and downstream Claude/Codex/Cursor projection.

## Prerequisites

- Bun 1.2 or newer;
- npm for global package installation and npm-backed skill bundles;
- Git for Card publication/resolution;
- any optional third-party runtimes used by selected skills or MCP servers.

| Goal | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Run the published package | **Bun 1.2+** and **npm** |
| Develop from source | **Bun 1.2+**, **npm**, and **Git** |

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
npm install -g darwinian
drwn --version
drwn status
```

From a source checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/remyjkim/darwinian-worker.git
cd darwinian-worker
bun install
bun run drwn -- status
```

For development:

```bash
bun link
drwn --help
```

## State Locations

Machine Store state lives under `~/.agents/drwn/`:

```text
machine.json
sources/
cards/
extracted/
skills/
mcp-servers/
catalogs/
generated/
projects.json
credentials.json
```

Project authority lives under:

```text
<project>/.agents/drwn/config.json
<project>/.agents/drwn/card.lock
```

Local development overrides use `config.local.json` and `card.lock.local`. Generated output and downstream tool files are disposable projections.

Whole-Store export is disabled because the Store can contain credentials and operational state. `drwn store export` fails with `STORE_EXPORT_DISABLED_UNSAFE`.

## Mental Model

```text
author Cards -> compose one Blueprint -> add roots -> select one Worker -> write
```

- A Card is one reusable capability.
- A Blueprint composes ordered plain Cards into one Worker.
- A project may install multiple roots as alternatives.
- `activeWorker` explicitly selects one root or is `null`.
- `drwn write` projects the selected root closure and explicit project overlays.
- Machine default selections are not inherited into project declarations.

## Initialize A Project

```bash
cd /path/to/project
drwn init --non-interactive
```

This writes:

```json
{
  "schema": "drwn.project-config",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "workers": [],
  "activeWorker": null
}
```

Interactive `drwn init` can guide current extension setup. The Recommended Darwinian Operator machine profile is future Task 80 behavior and is not part of this project contract.

Commit `.agents/drwn/config.json` and `.agents/drwn/card.lock`. Keep local overlay files ignored.

## Use A Published Worker

Apply one published plain Card or Blueprint root:

```bash
drwn apply @team/operator@^1.0.0
drwn status --json
drwn write --dry-run
drwn write
```

Applying one root selects it. For alternatives, selection must be explicit:

```bash
drwn apply @team/operator@^1.0.0 @team/alternate@^1.0.0 --active @team/operator
```

Manage roots:

```bash
drwn add @team/another@^1.0.0
drwn pin @team/operator@1.2.3
drwn update
drwn update @team/operator
drwn remove @team/another
```

Manage selection:

```bash
drwn use @team/operator
drwn use @team/operator --no-write
drwn use --none
```

`drwn use` writes by default. `--no-write` commits intent without downstream projection.

## Author A Capability Card

```bash
drwn card new @team/notion --no-git
drwn card source add-skill @team/notion notion-knowledge
drwn card source add-mcp @team/notion notion
drwn card source doctor @team/notion --json
drwn card publish @team/notion
```

Editable source state is mutable. Published Card versions are immutable.

## Compose A Blueprint

```bash
drwn worker new @team/operator --no-git
drwn worker compose @team/operator --add @team/notion@^1.0.0
drwn worker compose @team/operator --add @team/fal@^1.0.0
drwn card source doctor @team/operator --json
drwn worker publish @team/operator
```

The Blueprint's member order determines closure order. Members remain independently authored Cards, but the project selects the Blueprint as one Worker.

## Clone A Managed Project

After cloning a project that already commits supported config and lock:

```bash
drwn install --frozen --json
```

`--frozen` requires every locked artifact to be present and refuses fetch/lock changes. For normal hydration:

```bash
drwn install --no-write --json
drwn write --dry-run --json
drwn install --json
```

Install hydrates exact locked Cards and writes by default. It never changes root requirements or selection.

## Direct Project Capabilities

Explicit project overlays remain available:

```bash
drwn add skill <skill-name-or-query>
drwn add mcp <server-name>
drwn extensions add parallel
drwn extensions add beads --target=codex,claude --include-skill
drwn extensions add markitdown
drwn write --dry-run
```

These mutate only project intent. They do not make capabilities machine defaults.

## Machine Capabilities

Current machine-scope selections are managed separately:

```bash
drwn library list
drwn library defaults add skill <skill-name>
drwn library defaults add mcp <server-name>
drwn library defaults list
drwn write --scope machine --dry-run
drwn write --scope machine
```

Machine capabilities may be ambient to downstream project sessions because the downstream tool reads user-home configuration. Project status and doctor distinguish that ambient visibility from project declarations.

## Notion, `ntn`, And Momentic

Cards may carry definitions and skills, but installation and credentials are operator state:

- authorize Notion's hosted MCP in each downstream client that needs it;
- place an `ntn` API key in operator environment/secret storage;
- install and authenticate Momentic or another stdio executable separately;
- keep `.env`, tokens, cookies, and OAuth grants out of Cards, Blueprints, config, lock, and generated files.

An OAuth-required, executable-missing, timeout, or initialize-handshake error is a runtime readiness diagnosis. It does not imply that the project Worker graph is corrupt.

## Verify

```bash
drwn status --json
drwn status --why skill:<name>
drwn doctor --json
drwn write --dry-run
```

Verify:

- config is `drwn.project-config` V1;
- lock is `drwn.project-lock` V1;
- one intended root is selected or selection is explicit `null`;
- Blueprint member order is correct;
- generated state has one aggregate directory per root;
- declared and ambient capabilities are separated;
- config and lock do not change during write;
- no secret appears in project state.

## Unsupported Development Projects

The first supported contract does not read prototype project state. Follow [`docs/prelaunch-project-reset.md`](docs/prelaunch-project-reset.md) to preserve authored Card sources, remove unsupported project intent/projection, and initialize clean V1 state. There is no automated migration.

## Environment Overrides

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS_REPO_ROOT` | Use a source checkout as packaged assets. |
| `AGENTS_DIR` | Override the machine Agents directory. |
| `AGENTS_HOME_DIR` | Override user-home resolution for isolated tests. |
| `DRWN_STORE_READONLY=1` | Reject Store mutation while allowing reads/dry-runs. |
| `DRWN_TOKEN` | Headless Darwinian API authentication. |
| `DRWN_FETCH_CONCURRENCY` | Concurrent Card/skill fetch limit. |
| `DRWN_GIT_TIMEOUT_MS` | Git operation timeout. |
