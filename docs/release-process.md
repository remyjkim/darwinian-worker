# Release Process

## Releasing a new CLI version: Darwinian Worker 1.4.2

The CLI release is a two-event, exact-byte process. Manual dispatch can only
qualify current `main`; it cannot publish. A later exact annotated `v1.4.2` tag
authorizes candidate publication of the one artifact uploaded by that dry run. No path
treats an already-published version as successful qualification of new source.

### 1. Complete and qualify source

Finish the issue work and run the consolidated local and hosted gates on the
exact candidate head:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run verify:bridge
bun run verify:release
```

Package version, runtime version, and generated build identity must agree on
`1.4.2`. A source/development identity is explicitly non-eligible. Source
availability is not installed qualification: the workflow must generate the
build identity from clean Git, pack once, require the org/Deployed Worker management,
materialize, Buzz, secret, launch-context and auth members, install that exact tar,
and run the fixed safe version/help smoke set.
The distinction between source availability and installed qualification remains
part of the retained release evidence.

### 2. Run the immutable dry run

Dispatch `CLI Release` from `main` with version `1.4.2` and `dry_run: true`.
The workflow rejects any other ref, a moved `origin/main`, a package-version
mismatch, an indeterminate registry result, or an existing `darwinian@1.4.2`.
It runs the full qualification gates, packs once, installs once, and uploads
exactly:

- `darwinian-1.4.2.tgz`; and
- `release-candidate.json`.

Record the dry-run run ID and attempt, artifact ID and digest, source commit,
tar SHA-1/SHA-256/integrity/byte length, and workflow URL from the completed run.
The uploaded receipt was written before upload; mutable artifact outputs are not
injected into it later.

Stop after the dry run. Obtain explicit authorization naming that exact
run/artifact and separately authorizing publication-control configuration,
readback, and publication. A successful dry run is not publication authority.

### 3. Read back publication controls

Before creating a tag, an authorized administrator must configure and read back
fresh, normalized evidence for both external control planes:

- GitHub environment `darwinian-npm-publish` matches the declared approval
  policy in `scripts/release/release-policy.json` for required reviewers and
  self-review, disallows admin bypass, enables custom deployment policies, and
  admits only tag `v1.4.2`. Under the current policy the tag is created by
  `remyjkim` and the deployment is approved by the distinct `mind001-cl`
  credential with self-review prevented, so the `remyjkim` token alone cannot
  both authorize and publish. Both identities belong to the same maintainer, so
  this is credential separation, not independent human review. Changing it is a
  reviewed edit to the policy file, never an undeclared change to GitHub
  settings.
- npm trusted publishing binds package `darwinian` to
  `remyjkim/darwinian-worker`, workflow `release.yml`, environment
  `darwinian-npm-publish`, and action `npm publish` only.
- npm publishing access is `require_2fa_disallow_tokens`.

Attach the sanitized, timestamped readback receipts to I239. Missing,
unverifiable, stale, differently scoped, or secret-bearing evidence is a stop.
The workflow revalidates these receipts inside the protected job; architecture
or source review is not a substitute for external configuration readback.

### 4. Authorize with one annotated tag

Create a tag message containing a human title and exactly one closed machine
block. Substitute only values copied from the successful dry run:

```text
Darwinian Worker CLI v1.4.2

-----BEGIN DARWINIAN WORKER RELEASE AUTHORIZATION-----
schema=darwinian.worker.release-authorization
schema_version=1
version=1.4.2
dry_run_run_id=<run-id>
dry_run_run_attempt=<attempt>
artifact_id=<artifact-id>
artifact_digest=sha256:<artifact-archive-digest>
-----END DARWINIAN WORKER RELEASE AUTHORIZATION-----
```

Create and inspect the annotated `v1.4.2` tag locally before pushing it:

```bash
git tag -a v1.4.2 --file release-tag-message.txt
git cat-file -p refs/tags/v1.4.2
git push origin v1.4.2
```

The tag workflow requires the tag to peel to the dry-run source, the checkout,
and freshly fetched `origin/main`. It retrieves the exact run, attempt, jobs, and
artifact by ID; verifies the archive digest before extraction; and rejoins the
receipt, packaged build identity, and measured tar. It never searches for a
merely similar run.

### 5. Approve exact-tar OIDC candidate publication

Only `Publish I336 candidate to npm` enters `darwinian-npm-publish` and receives
`id-token: write`. After policy-conformant approval it repeats the default-branch,
control-readback, registry-freshness, archive-digest, receipt, build, and tar
checks. It then publishes the downloaded exact tarball; it does not repack the
checkout:

```bash
npm publish "./candidate/darwinian-1.4.2.tgz" --access public --tag i336-candidate
```

There is no `NPM_TOKEN` or maintainer-token fallback for the `darwinian` CLI.
Failure before publication requires a new successful dry run and new annotated
authorization. Do not reuse a stale run or edit/move the tag.

### 6. Verify registry bytes and unchanged latest routing

After propagation, npm version, `gitHead` when reported, shasum, and integrity
must equal the qualified candidate before the Ubuntu and macOS installed smokes
run. The workflow must also prove `i336-candidate` resolves to `1.4.2` and the
post-publication `latest` value equals the recorded prior value. This workflow
cannot call `npm dist-tag`, move `latest`, or create a final GitHub Release.
Current npm trusted-publishing OIDC does not authenticate `npm dist-tag`; final
promotion therefore remains blocked on a separately approved interactive npm-2FA
ceremony or another reviewed non-OIDC credential authority.

The read-only registry metadata check is:

```bash
npm view darwinian@1.4.2 version gitHead dist.shasum dist.integrity --json
npm view darwinian dist-tags --json
```

Record the registry metadata, both installed-smoke results, tag/commit, workflow
run, protocol digest, prior/resulting latest readback, and candidate SHA in
`.ai/tasks/cl0239_darwinian_worker_cli_release_completion.md`.

Released capability is not live environment evidence. I236 and I238 own their
separate credentials, staging, management/Buzz, and operational qualification gates.
Worker publication is also distinct from Services adoption. Do not describe a
green release as deployment, live Buzz delivery, membership, resource
authorization, or production traffic proof.

### Recovery after npm publication

If npm candidate publication succeeds but a later registry or installed smoke
fails, the ordinary workflow cannot be rerun because `1.4.2` now exists. Do
not treat a successful npm publish step as a green release. The original
`.github/workflows/release-recovery.yml` is frozen under `v1.4.2` and requires
registry `gitHead`. It remains available only when that field is present and
matches the tagged source.

Dispatch `CLI Release Recovery` with ref `v1.4.2`, the exact failed canonical
release run ID, and this closed authorization JSON (with the real canonical
timestamp and run ID):

```json
{
  "schema": "darwinian.worker.release-recovery-authorization",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "authorizedAt": "2026-08-08T00:00:00.000Z",
  "tag": "v1.4.2",
  "failedRunId": 123456789,
  "action": "verify_candidate"
}
```

Recovery enters `darwinian-npm-publish` for policy-conformant approval but has no
OIDC, npm token, publish, repack, tag mutation/push, dist-tag, or unpublish
capability. It requires the existing tag, failed canonical run, dry-run
authorization, unexpired artifact, receipt, npm `gitHead`, and registry tar bytes
to agree and proves `i336-candidate` still resolves to `1.4.2`. It may run
Ubuntu/macOS installed smokes only. It cannot create or repair a GitHub Release.
Any identity mismatch stops
for a separately authorized deprecation and patch roll-forward decision.

### Verification when npm omits `gitHead`

For the observed candidate under `i336-candidate`, npm did not expose
`gitHead`; its first metadata read was also visible before a fresh npm pack
could resolve the version. The old tag-locked recovery cannot pass this
condition. Use the reviewed-main `.github/workflows/release-verify-published.yml`
instead, only after its separate `darwinian-release-verification` environment
has been configured and read back with sole required reviewer `mind001-cl`,
self-review prevention, no admin bypass, and a main-only deployment policy.
It must have no secrets or OIDC trust. Dispatch from current `main` with
`failed_run_id=37105684003` and a fresh closed recovery authorization JSON
using the schema above, tag `v1.4.2`, and action `verify_candidate`.
This is a new protected approval; the old publish approval is not reusable.
An unprotected preflight checks the live policy before the protected job can
be scheduled. The job re-reads it after approval, and the final receipt
requires GitHub to report an actual `mind001-cl` approval for this environment.

The verifier rejoins the exact failed run, immutable tag, successful dry run,
artifact ID/digest, receipt, and packed identity. A present registry `gitHead`
must match. When it is absent, the remaining metadata and directly downloaded
canonical npm tar must match the authorized artifact, including SHA-256 and
package members. Ubuntu and macOS must both run installed smokes. It retains
a redacted receipt only after both jobs pass. It has no publish, OIDC, token,
repack, retag, dist-tag, unpublish, or GitHub Release path. The original red
run remains red; this is a separate verified recovery record.

`latest` must still equal the prior `1.3.0` until a separately approved
interactive npm-2FA promotion. Verify registry bytes, candidate tag, latest
readback, and installed behavior before and after that operation. If any
identity or platform check fails, stop rather than bypassing the gate.

## Releasing `drwn-command-bridge`

`drwn-command-bridge` is a separate npm package with its own version, workflow,
trusted-publisher binding, environment, and release decision. The CLI release
gate verifies the bridge but never publishes it.

Before publishing a bridge version:

1. In `drwn-command-bridge/`, run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and
   `bun run verify`.
2. Record a native macOS end-to-end smoke through Claude Desktop or an
   equivalent MCP stdio client: initialization, tool listing, one allowlisted
   command, one denied command, and the audit chain. Exercise `sandbox-exec`
   when present.
3. Keep Linux and Windows native-validation gaps explicit in the bridge README.
4. Confirm absence with `npm view drwn-command-bridge@<version> version`.
5. Dispatch `Command Bridge Release` from `main`, enter the exact version, and
   leave dry run disabled. Approve its separate protected `npm-publish`
   environment.

If GitHub Actions is unavailable, the bridge alone retains its independently
gated temporary-config fallback in `docs/maintainers/publishing.md`:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

Do not add or enable an `npx`-backed registry entry until that bridge version is
available on npm. Local validation should invoke the built file with
`node /absolute/path/to/drwn-command-bridge/dist/index.js`.
